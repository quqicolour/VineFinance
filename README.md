## ✨ Intro
Vine finance is an innovative modular DeFi revenue protocol that enables seamless integration with multiple DeFi protocols on different blockchains through powerful cross-chain technology. 

In the EVM ecosystem, Vine supports deep docking with mainstream Defi protocols such as Aave V3, Compound, Uniswap V3, Uniswap V2, Morpho, Gains, and Aerodrome. 

In the Solana ecosystem, it integrates with premium protocols such as Raydium, Jup and Kamino; In the Move ecosystem, compatibility with protocols such as Cetus and Navi is supported.

The unique strength of Vine finance is that it empowers users with flexibility and creativity. Users can create a personalized investment strategy based on their own needs, or choose to follow the curator's strategy mix. 

With facilities that support cross-chain communication, users can capture higher returns on other chains on a single chain without having to migrate assets to other chains, significantly increasing the efficiency of capital utilization

## ✨ Why use vine?
There are already thousands of chains on the blockchain, but chains are independent of each other, resulting in a large amount of capital dispersion, and many of these funds are used in Defi. 

For example: Aave V3, ordinary users want to go to Defi pledge farming, but because there are different chains of Aave V3, and these funds are not interworking, the benefits between different chains are different, which causes users want to deposit into the protocol, but can not get the high-yield part of the protocol, especially on the Ethereum main network. 

The dreaded high Gas prices are terrifying to the average retail investor. If a user goes through Vine, then he can capture, for example, Ethereum's current highest pledge yield on a cheap layer2.

## Become a curator
Users can register as a curator directly through Vine's Governance and then choose trusted factory modules to create their own policies.
